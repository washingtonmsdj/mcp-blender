# ORDAX Dev ÔÇö OpenAI MCP annotation review evidence

Generated from the canonical public tool surface on `control-plane/cloudflare/src/mcp_http.ts`.

This document is reviewer-facing evidence for the OpenAI plugin submission. The server advertises explicit boolean `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, and `openWorldHint` values for every public MCP tool. The justifications below explain why each value matches the tool's behavior.

## Classification policy

- **Read-only**: retrieval, bounded inspection, health/status, search, preview metadata, and artifact/file reads.
- **Non-destructive write**: additive state such as creating a handoff, directory, primitive, or starting/adopting Blender.
- **Destructive/write**: operations that can overwrite, patch, move, delete, save, transform, execute commands, or otherwise mutate existing state.
- **Open-world**: Git/terminal commands and managed-browser or desktop-input operations that can reach arbitrary external destinations are marked open-world. Private ORDAX account/device/project reads are not open-world merely because the Control Plane is remotely hosted.

The runtime still enforces account, device, project, Space, and action grants independently of these host-facing hints.
